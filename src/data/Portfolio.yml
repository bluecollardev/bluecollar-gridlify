      As Caffe Tech was expanding their business and opening multiple new

      synchronize their QuickBooks Desktop / Online customers, inventory and
      stock levels, invoices, work orders and more with their existing
      e-commerce websites (Caffe Tech, Leva, ACE Coffee Roasters). We designed
      an event-driven software bridge, composed of an OAuth2 secured RESTful
      micro-service, and custom ‘client’ extensions for Magento and OpenCart,
      that automatically handled synchronization of all data across multiple
      installations and software systems using a combination of PHP, Slim,
      Doctrine ORM/DBAL, MySQL and the QuickBooks Online API and Desktop SDK.

      in-house, web-based application and backend service network.

      
      **Our Solution**
      
      
      We spearheaded the overhaul of AMA’s web-based AgentView insurance
      management system and the network of .NET Web API and WCF services that
      supports it. The scope of work involved a complete rewrite of AgentView’s
      client and server applications as well as complete UI redesign (a previous
      external contractor had failed). We was also responsible for UI/UX design
      related to internal and external web-based applications.

      **Our Solution**
  
  
      We designed and built WordPress plugins to create, display, and update product matrices
      which were displayed on their corporate website and online "stores". It featured a GUI
      to create grid/matrix supporting CRUD functions for resource (product) rows, columns and cells,
      inline AJAX-based editing, cell content overriding as well as a style editor for formatting
      resource rows, columns and cells
